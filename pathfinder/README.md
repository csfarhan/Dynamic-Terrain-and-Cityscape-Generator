`Graph Library`

This is a Java library that provides a Graph ADT representing nodes and edges, and an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes.

`Author`

This library was created by Farhan Rahman, to be able to implement Dijkstra's algorithm and find the shortest path between two nodes.

`Rationale`

Graphs are a fundamental data structure used in many areas of computer science. By implementing a Graph ADT and a pathfinding algorithm, this library provides a foundation for building more complex graph-based applications.

`Usage`

To use the library, simply import the Graph and Pathfinder classes, and create a graph with nodes and edges. You can then use the findShortestPath method of the Pathfinder class to find the shortest path between two nodes in the graph.

Example usage:

```Graph graph = new Graph();
Node nodeA = new Node("A");
Node nodeB = new Node("B");
Node nodeC = new Node("C");

graph.addNode(nodeA);
graph.addNode(nodeB);
graph.addNode(nodeC);

graph.addEdge(nodeA, nodeB, 5);
graph.addEdge(nodeB, nodeC, 10);
graph.addEdge(nodeA, nodeC, 20);

Pathfinder pathfinder = new Pathfinder();
List<Node> shortestPath = pathfinder.findShortestPath(graph, nodeA, nodeC);

System.out.println("Shortest path: " + shortestPath);
```
`Extending the Library`

This library provides an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes. However, there are many other pathfinding algorithms that could be implemented to extend this library.

For example, we could implement A* search, a heuristic search algorithm that combines the cost of the path with an estimate of the distance to the goal. A* search can often find the shortest path more quickly than Dijkstra's algorithm, especially when the graph is large or the cost function is non-uniform.

To implement A* search, we would need to create a new class that implements the PathFinder interface, and modify the findShortestPath method to use the A* algorithm instead of Dijkstra's algorithm.

Another way to extend the library would be to add support for directed graphs or weighted graphs, which are common in many applications. We could modify the Edge class to include a direction attribute or a weight attribute, and modify the Graph class and Pathfinder class to handle directed or weighted graphs appropriately.

Overall, this library provides a flexible foundation for building more complex graph-based applications, and can be easily extended to support different algorithms and graph types.
